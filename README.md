# Leukemia Classification with Gradcam
In this notebook we have implemented the gradcam algorithm for leukemia classification using a library tf-keras-vis. We have compared GradCam, GradCam++ and ScoreCam with Lime algorithm. We first trained the model and saved the weights and then load the weights as a pre-trained model.
